# Month 1 Overview


## 🎯 Goal

This month is designed to guide Web2 developers into the Web3 world by grounding them in Ethereum fundamentals and introducing Layer 2 (L2) technologies early. Participants will progressively build skills through weekly modules that include hands-on labs, mini-projects, and a capstone dApp deployed to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet.

| 1    | Web3 Paradigms & the Rollup Revolution      | Web2 → Web3 → L2s, Arbitrum intro, MetaMask, L2 transaction UX              |
| 2    | Solidity & Contract Development for L2      | Solidity basics, Remix, Hardhat, Foundry, deploying contracts to Arbitrum   |
| 3    | Wallets, Tokens & Layer 2 Integration       | Wallet UX, bridging, ERC standards, NFT minting on Arbitrum                 |
| 4    | dApps, Frontends & L2 UX Design             | Full-stack dApps, gasless UX, L2 infra, DAOs, Arbitrum ecosystem            |



Each week combines **theory**, **tooling**, and a **hands-on mini project** to solidify learning.

## 🧪 Capstone Project: My First Fullstack Arbitrum dApp

At the end of Month 1, choose and build a full-stack dApp entirely on Arbitrum Sepolia. Capstone options include:

### 🪙 L2 Token Faucet

Build a minimal clone of the Arbitrum token faucet.  
- Learn how ERC-20 contracts work through hands-on implementation  
- Add claim logic with cooldowns or rate-limiting  
- Build a simple frontend with MetaMask integration and claim history via events  

---

### 🎨 NFT Minter dApp

Create your own NFT minting app from scratch.  
- Use OpenZeppelin to deploy an ERC-721 contract on Arbitrum  
- Pin images and metadata to IPFS (via Pinata or NFT.Storage)  
- Display minted NFTs in a frontend gallery view  

---

### 🗳️ Simple DAO

Launch a basic on-chain DAO with token-based governance.  
- Deploy an ERC-20 voting token  
- Enable proposal creation and voting logic  
- Simulate a full vote cycle and show results in the UI 

These projects ensures how to apply everything from wallets and contracts to frontend integration and event tracking.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By the end of Month 1, you will be able to:

- Explain the difference between L1 and L2, and how Arbitrum rollups work
- Write, compile, and deploy smart contracts using Solidity
- Use MetaMask and bridges on Arbitrum testnets
- Build full-stack dApps with Web3 tooling
- Interact with DAOs and understand Web3 governance
